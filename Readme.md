## Learning project

there are two servers in this project

one is playing role of our service that we work on
and can be spined up running `node server.js` inside of root folder

second one playing role of external api that we send a request to get data from DB
and can be spined up running `npm run json:server` inside of root folder 

So that is how we run two servers in parallel
